# OpenFlow

OpenFlow is basically a couple of [NodeRED](https://nodered.org/) installation and an API on top of a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) instance, using [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) for scalability. It is designed to supplement digitalization strategies by giving an easy to use, highly scalable and secure platform that supports human workflows, automation of IT systems and things (Internet of things or classical production systems like SCADA/PLC). IT also functions as the dashboard and enabler of enterprise functionality of [OpenRPA](https://github.com/open-rpa/openrpa)
